# Putative_Disease_Gene_Identification_and_Drug_Repurposing_for_High_Blood_Pressure

Utilized bioinformatics and network medicine to identify HBP-related genes and repurpose existing
drugs. Built a disease interactome using PPI and GDA data, applied machine learning algorithms for
gene prediction, and conducted enrichment analysis. Identified 100 putative genes and validated
drug candidates using clinical trial data.
